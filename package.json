If I did something in the VSCode's inbuilt terminal (rather than the standalone Git Bash app), none of its text styles (syntax colors) will remain, making it harder to read. Here's a synax highlighter for Git bash specifically. There are other Syntax Higlighters out on the web, but unfortunately they differenciate by too few text types.",
