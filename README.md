# Syntax highlighter for Git Bash

Install
```
npm install

```
Development
```
npm run dev
```

Often I want to save my Git Bash logs so I can use them as reference later. If I did something in the VSCode's inbuilt terminal (rather than the standalone Git Bash app), none of its text styles (syntax colors) will remain, making it harder to read. Here's a synax highlighter for Git bash specifically. There are other Syntax Higlighters out on the web, but unfortunately they differenciate by too few text types.
